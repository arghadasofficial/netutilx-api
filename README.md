# 🚀 Netutilx API

Welcome to the official repository for the **Netutilx API**, the central backend powering the entire Netutilx ecosystem. This high-performance API is designed to provide robust network diagnostic tools for our Android, Desktop, and Web applications.

It processes requests for complex network operations and returns clean, structured, and easy-to-parse JSON data, making it the perfect engine for any network utility application.

## ✨ Core Features & Supported Utilities

The Netutilx API offers a suite of powerful network diagnostic tools through simple-to-use endpoints.

### ✅ DNS Info
Perform comprehensive DNS lookups for any domain or IP address. The API intelligently parses the raw output for all major record types (`A`, `NS`, `MX`, `SOA`, `TXT`, `PTR`) into a consistent, structured format.

### ✅ Ping Info
Measure network latency and packet loss to any host. The Ping endpoint sends ICMP packets and returns detailed statistics, including round-trip times (min/avg/max) and packet transmission summaries, helping you diagnose network connectivity and quality.

### ✅ Traceroute Info
Map the complete network path from our server to a destination host. The Traceroute endpoint identifies every hop along the route, providing insights into network routing, potential bottlenecks, and points of failure.
